# k4s

A hobby virtual CPU, assembly language ("k4sm"), assembler for the assembly language, LLVM bitcode parser to lower LLVM bitcode to k4sm assembly language, and emulator / virtual machine for the virtual CPU that runs the compiled assembly code.

It was created for my own education on how CPUs and compilers work.
